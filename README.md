# Eight-Puzzle

This project was for CS 170: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at UCR. The program solve the eight-puzzle using Uniform Cost Search, A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic, and A* with Manhattan Distance heuristic.


## Issues

Program doesn't correctly handle duplicate nodes so Uniform Cost Search and Misplaced Tile Heuristic don't solve the puzzle for difficult problems.
